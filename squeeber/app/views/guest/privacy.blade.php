															<strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
															Basic Information: When you create or reconfigure a Squeeber account, you provide some personal 
															information, such as your name, password, and email address. In some cases, 
															you may be required to provide your phone number. Your name and username are
															 listed publicly on our Services. General services such as viewing and posting squeeb(notices)
															  do not require registration.
															<br /><br />
															Links: Squeeber may keep track of how you interact with links across 
															our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, 
															and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. 
															We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant 
															advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as 
															how many times a particular link was clicked on.
															
															<br /><br />
															Cookies: Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional 
															website usage data and to improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that is 
															transferred to your computer's hard disk. Squeeber may use both session cookies and 
															persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor 
															aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize 
															and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can 
															instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt 
															you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may 
															not function properly if you disable cookies.
															
															<br /><br />
															Log Data: When you use our Services, we may receive information ("Log Data") 
															such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, 
															pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and 
															application IDs), search terms, and cookie information. We receive Log Data when you 
															interact with our Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into our 
															Services, interact with our email notifications, use your Squeeber account to 
															authenticate to a third-party website or application, or visit a third-party website

															as provided below for Widget Data, we will either delete Log Data or remove any common 
															account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after
